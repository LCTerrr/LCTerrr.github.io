                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                        clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                        another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                        server.

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many
                different
                versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an
                official
                standard in December 1999. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.

                was first proposed in 1994, by Norwegian technologist HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, who was then working at the
                European
                Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with Berners-Lee. Two years later the World Wide Web Consortium
                (W3C)
                adopted the first standardized specifications for CSS, called CSS1.

                In 1994, Hakon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer, and Bert Bos, a Dutch programmer, proposed the first
                CSS
                specification. Their vision was to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), thus simplifying web
                development

                    Is a platform for hosting code that allows for version control and collaboration. It allows you and
                    others to
                    collaborate on projects from anywhere. This lesson will teach you the fundamentals of GitHub, such
                    as
                    repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

                    The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott
                    Chacon using
                    Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed as of 2007 and
                    is located

                    Git has several different ways of showing the history of a repository. When Git shows the history of
                    a single
                    file, it simplifies history by omitting commits that did not change the file. Instead of looking at
                    every
                    commit to decide whether it touched the file, Git will omit a whole branch if that branch, when
                    merged, did
                    not impact the final contents of the file. Any commits on the branch that touched the file will not
                    be shown.

                    <li>git clone: This command is used to clone a repository from a remote source to the local machine.</li>
                    <li>git add . : is used in Git to stage all files that have been modified or added in the working directory for the next commit. This command stages all changes, including new files, modified files, and deleted files, preparing them to be included in the upcoming commit. It is a convenient way to add all changes at once before committing them to the repository.</li>
                    <li>git commit -m "message": This command is used to commit changes with a specific message.</li>
                    <li>git push: is used to transfer the committed changes from the local repository to a remote repository. When you execute git push, you are essentially pushing the committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository, making them accessible to other team members or collaborators. This command is crucial for sharing your work with others and keeping the remote repository up to date with your local changes.</li>
                    <li>git pull: This command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to the local repository.</li>
                    <li>git log: This command provides a detailed log of commits, allowing users to search, filter, and format logs in various ways.</li>
                    <li>git branch: This command is used to list, create, delete, and manage branches in a repository.</li>

                    Is a tool that creates a secure connection between a public endpoint and a local machine, allowing
                    encrypted and secure traffic. It works by mapping a local development server to its own server,
                    enabling external access to the local server through a public IP address. Ngrok uses a combination
                    of cryptography and network routing techniques to establish this connection, ensuring data security.
                    Despite its benefits, Ngrok has some challenges, including security risks, reliability issues,
                    dependency on a third-party service, limited customization, and a restricted free plan. The tool
                    operates through a global network of servers called the "ngrok edge," forwarding traffic to upstream
                    services via an agent that connects to ngrok's global service through secure TLS connections. Unlike
                    traditional reverse proxies, ngrok does not forward traffic to upstream services by IP addresses but
                    uses lightweight agent software running alongside or within the application. This unique
                    architecture allows services to run anywhere and provides ingress with zero networking
                    configuration. Ngrok can enforce authentication and protect against attacks without revealing
                    upstream IP addresses. The ngrok agent is a lightweight command-line program that forwards traffic
                    from endpoints created on the ngrok edge to upstream application services. It can be run as a
                    service, interactively from the command line, embedded in an app, or as a Kubernetes controller. The
                    agent can be managed with OS service tooling and includes commands for remote management via the
                    Tunnel Sessions API. Additionally, the ngrok API supports CORS and provides a Terraform provider for
                    defining resources using infrastructure-as-code practices.

                    Allows users to run a Linux environment on Windows without the need for a separate virtual machine.
                    Ubuntu is one of the Linux distributions that can be run on WSL, providing a seamless experience for
                    developers who want to use both Windows and Linux simultaneously. WSL provides low-level components
                    like a customized Linux kernel and utilities to enable various Linux distributions to target WSL.
                    Ubuntu on WSL offers an experience similar to running Ubuntu on bare-metal while leveraging the
                    strengths of WSL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>WSL has two versions: WSL 1 and WSL 2.</strong> WSL 1 acts as a compatibility layer for
                    running Linux binary executables by implementing Linux system calls. In contrast, WSL 2 runs inside
                    a managed virtual machine that implements the full Linux kernel, making it compatible with more
                    Linux binaries than WSL 1. WSL 2 was introduced in May 2019, bringing significant changes to the
                    architecture of WSL
                </p>
                <p>To manage distributions in WSL, the wsl.exe command is used on the command-line. It can list
                    available distributions, set a default distribution, uninstall distributions, and run Linux binaries
                    from the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. Additionally, WSLg (Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI)
                    enables support for running Linux GUI applications, providing graphics and audio support in WSL
                    apps. Prerequisites for WSLg include Windows 11 or Windows 10 Insider Preview builds and a system
                    with virtual GPU enabled for hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering.</p>

                <p>In terms of Ubuntu history and how it works on WSL, Ubuntu on WSL operates similarly to a native
                    Ubuntu environment, allowing users to access Ubuntu tools and functionalities within the Windows
                    ecosystem. Users can install Ubuntu on WSL via the Microsoft Store, import it using commands, or
                    sideload custom distributions. Each Linux distribution on WSL has its own user accounts and
                    passwords, requiring configuration upon installation or reset. Regularly updating and upgrading
                    packages using the preferred package manager is recommended. Windows Terminal is a recommended tool
                    for managing multiple command lines, and Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio are suggested code
                    editors for WSL development.</p>
