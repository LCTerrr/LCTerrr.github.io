            "King James", he is widely recognized as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and is
            often compared
            to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] He has competed in 10 NBA
            Finals (with
            eight consecutive appearances from 2011 to 2018), winning four NBA championships.[1] He also won the
            inaugural NBA Cup
            in 2023 with the Lakers, and two Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. men's national team.

        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Lebron James life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>James grew up playing basketball for<strong> St. Vincent–St. Mary High School </strong>in his hometown of
                Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around
                scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the
                Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the
                Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to
                their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[4] After
                failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami
                Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most
                controversial free agency moves in sports history.</li>
            <li>
                James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these
                years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in
                2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to
                victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the
                team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.[11] In 2018, James exercised his
                contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA
                championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1
                billion in earnings as an active player.[13] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
                become the leading scorer in league history.
            </li>
            <li>Off the court, James has earned more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been
                featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer),
                and television commercials. James was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005,
                2013, 2017, and 2019, the most selections by a professional athlete. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted
                Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a
                part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened
                an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Early life</em></strong>
                James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of
                his birth.[16]: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not
                involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family,
                as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled
                to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment,
                Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who
                introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.</li>
            <li>James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union
                (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and
                national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24  The
                group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school
                together.[16]: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary
                High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.</li>
            <li><strong>High school career</strong>Basketball
                As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St.
                Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III
                state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As
                a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per
                game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of
                Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA
                scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as
                state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the
                USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.</li>
            <li>In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam
                magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01
                m), as "[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now".[27] During the season,
                James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball
                underclassman to do so.[16]: 104  With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals
                per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23]
                and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 
                St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the
                Division II championship game.[16]: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a
                change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During
                this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the
                constant media attention he was receiving.[30]</li>
            <li>Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of
                nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was
                nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity,
                offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the
                season.[16]: 143  For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals
                per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an
                unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for
                the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star
                games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American
                Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that
                he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[</li>
            <li>Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday,
                he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a
                loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an
                investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no
                amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of
                any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or
                any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an
                urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting
                in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his
                penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year.
                The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In
                his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent–St. Mary
                went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.</li>
            <li><strong>Football</strong> As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's
                football team.[16]: 51  He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the
                conclusion of his second year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the
                Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist
                injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high
                school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National
                Football League.[b]</li>
            <li><strong>Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)</strong> 2003–2004: Rookie of the Year

                James, pictured here in 2007, joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players to average
                better than 20 points, five rebounds and five assists per game as rookies during his 2003–04 season.
                James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003
                NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento
                Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut
                performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the
                NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per
                game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds,
                and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make
                the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.</li>
            <li><strong>2004–2008: Rise to superstardom</strong>In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA
                All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the
                Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets
                coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: "It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great
                player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule."[48] On March 20, James
                scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49]
                With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to
                his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to
                make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.</li>
            <li><strong>2006 All-Star Game</strong> James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA
                All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6
                assists per game,[4] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve
                Nash.[52] Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since
                1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the
                Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career,
                making another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the
                Detroit Pistons in the second round.</li>
            <li><strong>2006–2007 season</strong> James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and
                1.6 steals per game.[25] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and
                shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus.[59] The Cavaliers finished the season
                with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[60] In
                Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, James logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring
                29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109–107
                double-overtime victory against the Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert
                called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator Steve
                Kerr described it as "Jordan-esque".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in
                modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern
                Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] During the
                Finals, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6
                percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.</li>
